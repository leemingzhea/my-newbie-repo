Your Project's Name:
"The 1975 Experience." Whether you're a dedicated fan or a new comer to this band, my aim for this website is to serve as a gateway for people to explore their albums, getting to know the band members, and stay updated on the latest news.

Design Process:
My design process revolves around creating an engaging and intuitive platform for users. As a fan or music enthusiast, you can easily navigate through different sections, including Albums, About Us, and the option to Listen to their latest tracks. The design is focused on providing a seamless and enjoyable experience for users to connect with the band and their music.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:
-As a fan, I want to explore the band's discography and listen to their latest albums.
-As a curious visitor, I want to learn more about the band members and their journey in the music industry.
-As a music enthusiast, I want to stay updated on the band's latest releases and news.

Features:
-Navigation Bar: Easily navigate through different sections of the website, including Home, Albums, About, Listen, and Subscribe.
-Hero Section: Experience a visually stunning hero section with captivating images and a call-to-action button to listen to the latest music.
-Album Showcase: Explore the band's albums with a visually appealing grid layout, providing a glimpse of each album.
-Band Members: Get to know the talented members of The 1975 through individual profiles, including images and roles in the band.
-Listen Section: Stream the latest album directly through an embedded Spotify player.

Existing Features:

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

Features Left to Implement: Carousel slider for more albums/songs to feature on the website.
Another feature idea: Merchandise store

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.
-HTML: Structure of the web pages.
-CSS: Styling and layout design.
-Font Awesome: Icons for social media links.
-Spotify Embed: Integration and convenience for listening to the latest album.

Testing
For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

-Responsive design has been implemented and tested for compatibility by resizing my browser multiple times.

My website layout and structure looks fine on Chrome browser (full-screen, minimized).
The bugs that I encountered is my 'Albums' section when I resize it smaller, I could not figure out how to make it change its size according to browser's size.
